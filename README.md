# Image Classification

This project builds an image classification model using a pre-trained VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into four categories:
- Architecture
- Art and Culture
- Food and Drinks
- Travel and Adventure

Dataset from: 
Kaggle Google Scraped Image Dataset
